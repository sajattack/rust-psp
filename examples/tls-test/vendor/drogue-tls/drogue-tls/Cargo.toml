# Configure the inbound buffer size

# *Note:* By default a TLS client must be capable of receiving fragments of 2^14 bytes (16KiB).
# While it is possible to choose a smaller sending buffer, the server side will still try to send
# fragments larger than the choose inbound buffer, which this client then can no longer handle.
#
# It is possible to communicate remote peer the wish to reduce the maximum fragment length, when connecting
# (RFC6066 - Section 4: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-4). Whever this extension may
# be unsupported by the remote peer.
